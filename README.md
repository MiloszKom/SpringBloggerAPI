# SpringBloggerAPI

SpringBloggerAPI is a simple REST API built with Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Docker.
The project simulates a minimal blogging platform with Posts, Comments, and Users, and was created to practice applying familiar backend concepts within the Spring Boot ecosystem.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
* Java 17 ‚Äì Core language for Spring Boot
* Spring Boot ‚Äì REST API framework
* Spring Security ‚Äì Authentication and role-based access control
* Hibernate / JPA ‚Äì Object-relational mapping for PostgreSQL
* PostgreSQL ‚Äì Relational database for development and production
* AWS RDS ‚Äì Managed PostgreSQL instance for production
* Docker & Docker Compose ‚Äì Containerization for app and database
* Maven ‚Äì Build and dependency management
* JUnit & Spring Test ‚Äì Unit and integration testing

## üìö What I Practiced in This Project

Through this project, I practiced applying familiar backend concepts in a Spring Boot environment. I worked on:

* CRUD in Spring Boot ‚Üí Implemented a Post, Comment and User module with full Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality, using PostgreSQL as the database.
* DTOs and Validation ‚Üí Applied DTO patterns and input validation in the Spring context.
* Authentication & Authorization ‚Üí Set up login and registration endpoints, secured protected routes, and added role-based access control.
* Error Handling ‚Üí Improved error responses and exception management to fit Spring Boot‚Äôs best practices.
* Refactoring for Clean Design ‚Üí Split Post and User DTOs into detailed and summary variants for more efficient API design.
* Testing in Spring Boot ‚Üí Added initial unit tests and integration tests for posts and users.
* Docker Integration ‚Üí Containerized the application and database for local dev and production.
* Deployment with AWS RDS ‚Üí Configured the application to connect to a managed PostgreSQL instance on AWS RDS in production.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

Follow these steps to run the application in **development mode**:

---

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MiloszKom/SpringBloggerAPI.git
```

### 2. Create Environment File
In the project root, create a file named .env.dev.

Example .env.dev file:
```bash
DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/postgres
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=password

SPRING_SECURITY_USER_NAME=name
SPRING_SECURITY_USER_PASSWORD=password
```


### 3. Build the Project

Run Maven commands to clean and build the project:

```bash
mvn clean
mvn install
```


### 4. Start Docker Containers

Run the following command to build and start the app along with required services (e.g., database):
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

### 5. Verify the Setup

Open the app in your browser at:
üëâ http://localhost:8080
